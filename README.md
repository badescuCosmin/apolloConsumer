# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start:dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Steps that I did for this requirement

1 Created the basic template for the react app.
2 Installed the dependencies that were necessary for the project requirements.
3 Added Moment js for time manipulation.
4 Created the folder structure that can serve the project no matter how much the project scales.
5 Tied to keep everything organized : components / mappers / config / queries.
